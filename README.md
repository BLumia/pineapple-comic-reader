A comic reader client for *[YACReader](https://github.com/YACReader/yacreader) Library Server*.

> [!NOTE]
> This application, while already usable, is still in prototype stage. UI, UX can be pretty janky and the codebase can be pretty messy.

## Summary

Pineapple Comic Reader is an client-side application that allows you connect to a *[YACReader](https://github.com/YACReader/yacreader) Library Server* and read comics from the server. This enables you host your comic collections on a home server or NAS, and read comics on your PC, phone and tablets.

This application can be considered as an open-sourced alternative of [YACReader](https://yacreader.com/)'s first-party [Android client](https://android.yacreader.com/) and [iOS client](http://ios.yacreader.com/), but you can also use this application on PC.

## Get it!

Right now you can only build it from source. I'll update this section once the binary is ready to download.

### Another Alternative Android Client

While Pineapple Comic Reader can targetd to Android, I also made an alternative android client called "Pineapple Comics" which available on Google Play:

Please note that that one is different than the one provided by this repo, and that one is currently not open-sourced.

## CLA

```
By sending patches in GitHub Pull Request, Issues, email patch 
set, or any other form to this project, it is assumed that you
are offering the Pineapple Comic Reader project and the original
project author (Gary Wang) unlimited, non-exclusive right to
reuse, modify, and relicense the code.
```

This is important because the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM). Pineapple Comic Reader will always be available in an OSI approved, DFSG-compatible license. If you wish to specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you send them.
